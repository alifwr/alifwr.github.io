The model combined Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to leverage the strengths of both. The Transformer component was used to capture long-range dependencies and temporal relationships within the ECG signal, while the CNN layers were employed to extract local patterns and features effectively. The integration of these two models allowed for superior noise reduction,
particularly in handling complex and non-linear noise present in real-world ECG data. The denoising process significantly enhanced signal quality, making it easier to identify key features such as heart rate variability and detecting abnormal rhythms.`},{name:"Object Tracking using DeepSORT with Infrared Image Fusion",role:"Research Assistant",period:"Jul 2024 - Sep 2024",description:"An object tracking for robust human tracking application. The system fused the rgb image data with infrared image data to gain more robust object detection within the various lighting conditions. A kalman filter used to estimate the next position of the tracked human, and estimate the current position of a human that not detected in current frame. A deep learning model for appearance feature extraction was utilized. These appearance feature then used to associate a list of human in the previous frame with the current frame."},{name:"Biometric Security System using Deep Learning",role:"Research Assistant",period:"Apr 2024 - Jun 2024",description:"A web application with bio-metric security applied. In this work, a user who login needs to capture their face. The face image is then fed into the Siamese network to classify whether the person is the same as the login data and whether the image is live or fake. The Siamese network used InceptionNet as the feature extraction layer to generate embedding. Before the bio-metric verification process, the user faces should registered. The registration was done by storing the embedding values in a vector database named QdrantDB. The face image was given to the feature extraction layer in the verification process, resulting in the embedding values. Then, the system searches for the nearest similarity with stored embedding within the database. If the resulting embedding is identical to the login data from the user, then the user is verified to log in."},{name:"Omni-wheel Mobile Robot Localization and Mapping using Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)",role:"Freelance Project",period:"Mar 2024 - May 2024",description:`An Omni-wheel mobile robot can create a map of gas leakage intensities. This robot utilizes three gas sensors and uses the sensor data with
a neural network to classify the gas into three classes: butane, alcohol, and gasoline. The robot needs a precise localization system to create
a stunning and accurate map. A trilateration-based localization was used since the robot’s working area is in a warehouse, categorized as an
indoor environment. The trilateration employed ultra-wide-band technology. There were four UWB devices. The first UWB is placed in the
robot and works as a tag. The others were placed in a particular position and formed a triangle with certain distances.`},{name:"Human Following Robot using Optimized Adaptive Social Force Model",role:"Master Student",period:"Jan 2021 - Jul 2023",description:`A differential drive mobile robot that capable to follows certain person by detect and track the position of the human legs position. Human
